# About DeenBridge

**DeenBridge** is an AI-powered Islamic reference application designed to act as a sophisticated digital librarian, not a religious authority. It provides users with verifiable information from pre-vetted, trusted sources within both the Sunni and Shia traditions. With a unique persona-driven AI, customizable themes, and robust PWA support, DeenBridge offers a modern, secure, and personalized research experience.

## Our Mission

DeenBridge was built to address the need for a reliable, source-driven tool for Islamic inquiry. Unlike general-purpose chatbots, its core mandate is to ground every answer in established, verifiable texts, ensuring all information is traceable to its original scholarly context.

## Key Principles

*   **Librarian, Not Mufti:** The AI is explicitly programmed to provide information and summarize scholarly views, but never to issue religious rulings (fatwas). It consistently directs users to consult qualified scholars for personal guidance.
*   **Source Purity:** All scriptural results (Quran) are provided in their original Arabic, with on-demand translation and transliteration, preserving the integrity of the source text.
*   **User-Centric Design:** From the onboarding flow that personalizes the AI's tone to the multiple color themes, the experience is designed to be welcoming, accessible, and intuitive.
*   **Privacy First:** DeenBridge operates entirely on the frontend. No user data, profile information, or chat history is ever sent to a backend server. All data is stored securely in the user's local browser storage.

## Features

*   **Dual Denomination Support:** Users can select either the Sunni or Shia school of thought to tailor the AI's knowledge base to the most relevant sources.
*   **Persona-Driven AI:** The AI guide is inspired by the direct, humorous, and analogy-rich style of prominent scholars, making complex topics more approachable.
*   **Verifiable Sources:** Every response is grounded in a curated list of trusted Tafsir and Fiqh literature. Web search results are clearly marked as trusted or unverified.
*   **On-the-fly Translation & Transliteration:** Scriptural texts can be translated into over 100 languages or transliterated with a single click.
*   **Installable PWA:** DeenBridge is a fully-featured Progressive Web App, installable on desktop and mobile devices for a native-app feel and offline access.
*   **Customizable Themes:** Choose from four beautiful themes (Light, Dark, Majlis, Madinah) to suit your preference.
*   **Personalized Experience:** An onboarding flow captures user details (name, age, context) to tailor the AI's communication style.
*   **Multimedia & Voice Input:** Supports file uploads (images, documents) and includes a voice-to-text feature for hands-free queries.
*   **Secure & Private:** 100% client-side application. Your data stays with you.
