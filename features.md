# DeenBridge Features

This document provides a detailed overview of the key features available in the DeenBridge application.

## Core AI & Interaction

-   **Persona-Driven AI:** The AI guide adopts a persona inspired by the direct, humorous, and analogy-rich style of prominent scholars. This makes complex topics more approachable and engaging for users.
-   **Denomination-Specific Knowledge Base:** Users can select either Sunni or Shia traditions during onboarding. This choice tailors the AI's primary sources, ensuring responses are grounded in the user's preferred school of thought.
-   **Verifiable & Sourced Responses:** Every answer from the AI is designed to be grounded in trusted sources. Scriptural and web citations are provided to allow users to verify the information.
-   **Client-Side Privacy:** The application is 100% client-side. All user data, including profile information and chat history, is stored exclusively in the browser's local storage and is never sent to a server.
