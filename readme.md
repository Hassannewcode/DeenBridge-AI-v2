## About The Project

DeenBridge was built to address the need for a reliable, source-driven tool for Islamic inquiry. Unlike general-purpose chatbots, its core mandate is to ground every answer in established, verifiable texts, ensuring all information is traceable to its original scholarly context.

**Key Principles:**

*   **Librarian, Not Mufti:** The AI is explicitly programmed to provide information and summarize scholarly views, but never to issue religious rulings (fatwas). It consistently directs users to consult qualified scholars for personal guidance.
*   **Source Purity:** All scriptural results (Quran & Hadith) are provided in their original Arabic, with on-demand translation and transliteration, preserving the integrity of the source text.
*   **User-Centric Design:** From the onboarding flow that personalizes the AI's tone to the multiple color themes, the experience is designed to be welcoming, accessible, and intuitive.
*   **Privacy First:** DeenBridge operates entirely on the frontend. No user data, profile information, or chat history is ever sent to a backend server. All data is stored securely in the user's local browser storage.

## Features

*   **Dual Denomination Support:** Users can select either the Sunni or Shia school of thought to tailor the AI's knowledge base to the most relevant sources.
*   **Persona-Driven AI:** The AI guide is inspired by the direct, humorous, and analogy-rich style of Sheikh Assim al-Hakeem, making complex topics more approachable.
*   **Verifiable Sources:** Every response is grounded in a curated list of trusted Hadith collections, Tafsir, and Fiqh literature. Web search results are clearly marked as trusted or unverified.
*   **On-the-fly Translation & Transliteration:** Scriptural texts can be translated into over 100 languages or transliterated with a single click.
*   **Installable PWA:** DeenBridge is a fully-featured Progressive Web App, installable on desktop and mobile devices for a native-app feel and offline access.
*   **Customizable Themes:** Choose from four beautiful themes (Light, Dark, Majlis, Madinah) to suit your preference.
*   **Personalized Experience:** An onboarding flow captures user details (name, age, context) to tailor the AI's communication style.
*   **Multimedia & Voice Input:** Supports file uploads (images, documents) and includes a voice-to-text feature for hands-free queries.
*   **Secure & Private:** 100% client-side application. Your data stays with you.

*   **Framework:** [React](https://reactjs.org/) (with Hooks) & [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
*   **AI Engine:** [Google Gemini API (`gemini-2.5-flash`)](https://ai.google.dev/) via the `@google/genai` SDK
*   **Styling:** [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) (via CDN)
*   **Modules:** Dynamically imported via [esm.sh](https://esm.sh/)

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

You need a modern web browser that supports ES Modules (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari).

### Environment Variables

The application requires a Google Gemini API key to function. This key **must** be provided as an environment variable by the hosting environment.

1.  Obtain an API Key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).
2.  Set the environment variable `API_KEY` in your deployment environment (e.g., Vercel, Netlify, or a local server).

   Example for a local environment using a `.env` file (requires a server that can load it):
   ```
   API_KEY="YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE"
   ```

**Important:** The application code directly uses `process.env.API_KEY`. It is designed this way assuming the deployment environment handles the injection of this variable.

### Running Locally

Since there is no build process, you just need to serve the files from the project's root directory.

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/deenbridge.git
    cd deenbridge
    ```
2.  Serve the directory using a simple local server. A great option is the `serve` package:
    ```sh
    npx serve
    ```
3.  Open your browser and navigate to the local URL provided by the server (e.g., `http://localhost:3000`).
