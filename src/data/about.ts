# About DeenBridge

**DeenBridge** is an AI-powered Islamic reference application designed to act as a sophisticated digital librarian, not a religious authority. It provides users with verifiable information from pre-vetted, trusted sources within both the Sunni and Shia traditions. With a unique persona-driven AI, customizable themes, and robust PWA support, DeenBridge offers a modern, secure, and personalized research experience.

## Our Mission

DeenBridge was built to address the need for a reliable, source-driven tool for Islamic inquiry. Unlike general-purpose chatbots, its core mandate is to ground every answer in established, verifiable texts, ensuring all information is traceable to its original scholarly context.

## Key Principles

*   **Librarian, Not Mufti:** The AI is explicitly programmed to provide information and summarize scholarly views, but never to issue religious rulings (fatwas). It consistently directs users to consult qualified scholars for personal guidance.
*   **Source Purity:** All scriptural results (Quran) are provided in their original Arabic, with on-demand translation and transliteration, preserving the integrity of the source text.
*   **User-Centric Design:** From the onboarding flow that personalizes the AI's tone to the multiple color themes, the experience is designed to be welcoming, accessible, and intuitive.
*   **Privacy First:** DeenBridge operates entirely on the frontend. No user data, profile information, or chat history is ever sent to a backend server. All data is stored securely in the user's local browser storage.
