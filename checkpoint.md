# Checkpoint: Live Conversation & Settings Overhaul

This checkpoint marks a significant enhancement to the DeenBridge application, focusing on a complete overhaul of the live conversation feature and the introduction of key user settings.

## Major Features & Updates

### 1. Real-Time Voice Interaction with Gemini Live API

-   **Full Integration:** The "Live Conversation" feature has been re-engineered from the ground up to use the **Gemini Live API**.
-   **Real-Time, Low-Latency Chat:** The application now supports a natural, real-time voice conversation. The AI listens as the user speaks and responds with spoken audio, creating a fluid back-and-forth interaction.
-   **Live Transcription:** A real-time transcript of the conversation is displayed in the modal, allowing users to follow along visually with both their input and the AI's responses.
-   **Robust Session Management:** Implemented proper handling for microphone access, audio streaming, and connection state to ensure a stable and reliable user experience.

### 2. User-Configurable Microphone Modes

-   **New Setting:** A "Live Chat Mic Mode" option has been added to the Settings panel.
-   **Toggle Mode (Default):** Users can tap the microphone icon to start speaking and tap again to stop.
-   **Hold-to-Talk Mode:** Users can press and hold the microphone icon to speak and release it to stop, offering a walkie-talkie style interaction.

### 3. Enhanced User Experience & Visual Feedback

-   **Dynamic Visualizer:** The orb in the live chat modal now provides intuitive visual feedback:
    -   *Pulses gently* when the microphone is active and listening.
    -   *Transforms into a vibrant sound wave* when the AI is speaking.
    -   *Remains idle* when the microphone is off.
-   **Default Male Voice:** The AI's default Text-to-Speech voice is now "Zephyr," a high-quality male voice from Gemini, which can be configured in the TTS settings.

## Bug Fixes & Technical Refinements

-   **Gemini Service:** Corrected a minor character error (`ั` vs. `ุณ`) in an example Arabic verse within the system instruction prompt.
-   **Speech Recognition Hook:** Added explicit TypeScript type definitions for the Web Speech API to resolve compilation errors and improve type safety.
-   **Live API Implementation:**
    -   Resolved type errors by updating `LiveSession` to the correct `Session` type from the `@google/genai` SDK.
    -   Fixed an issue where an `onopen` callback was incorrectly using `await` without being an `async` function.
    -   Refactored audio processing to use the `sessionPromise` directly, adhering to Gemini API best practices and preventing stale closures.
